In this project I built a back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I'll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

As a manager at an internet retail company
I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

I created an application to GET routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia Core.

In Insomnia Core, I tested “GET tags,” “GET Categories,” and “GET All Products.”.

I showed the application's GET routes to return a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Insomnia Core.

In Insomnia Core, I tested “GET tag by id,” “GET Category by ID,” and “GET One Product.”

In this application's POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories being tested in Insomnia Core.

I used the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.

I used the `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder to create your database with MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data like your MySQL username, password, and database name.
